# Useful Coding Guides for LLMs

This repository gathers concise resources for building modern Next.js 15 applications. It focuses on state management with Zustand and best practices recommended for the 2025 stack (Next.js 15.3+, React 19, TypeScript 5.6+). The guides are intended for developers who use large language models to reference or generate code.

## Contents

- **`NEXTJS15_BEST_PRACTICES.md`** – Detailed architecture and coding patterns for Next.js 15 and Zustand.
- **`NEXT_BEST_PRACTICES_IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`** – Checklist tracking adoption of the practices throughout a codebase.
- **`PROMPT_TO_GENERATE_AND_REVISE_GUIDES.md`** – The prompt used to research and refine these documents.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide an up‑to‑date, production‑ready blueprint for engineers working with Next.js. The documents summarize the latest community recommendations, helping teams plan migrations and keep track of implementation progress.
